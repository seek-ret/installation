Docker deployment  
Sniffer docker will passively sniff target container traffic and move the pcaps to the remote bucket.

There are 2 options:
1. [minio based deployment](minio.md) - Supports GCS, S3 and Azure.
2. [awscli based deployment](awscli.md) - Supports S3 bucket only, but support AWS role.
